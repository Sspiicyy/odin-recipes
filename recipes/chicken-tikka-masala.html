    <p>I've had some experience making curry, this one looks good.

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>&#189; teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>&#188; teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
        <li>1 14 ounce can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>16 ounces chicken thighs, bite sized</li>
        <li>&#189 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Personally, I recommend a tub of unflavored plain yogurt as well. If you opt for this, double the spices, but separate the doubled amounts.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>If you opted to get yogurt, dice the chicken thighs, 
            mix the chicken and all the spices into the yogurt. 
            Let this sit in the fridge, ideally overnight. </li>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato sauce into onion and spice mixture; bring to a boil and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, and paprika. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into hot oil; add curry powder (unless you opted for yogurt). Sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken and any pan juices into sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust sugar and salt to taste.</li>
    </ol>
